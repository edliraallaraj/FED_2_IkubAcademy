<h1>NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)</h1> 
</br></br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="parStyle">The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) is the leading independent advocacy organization representing all patients and families affected by rare diseases in the United States.
    NORD began as a small group of patient advocates that formed a coalition to unify and mobilize support to pass the Orphan Drug Act of 1983.
    Since then, the organization has led the way in voicing the needs of the rare disease community, driving supportive policies, furthering education, advancing medical research, and providing patient and family services for those who need them most. 
    Together with over 300 disease-specific member organizations, more than 15,000 Rare Action Network advocates across all 50 states, and national and global partners, NORD delivers on its mission to improve the lives of those impacted by rare diseases.Offering a transformative approach to care, the program addresses an unmet need for collaboration across the medical community that will help fuel an era of faster diagnoses, new treatment guidelines, best practices, and knowledge sharing. Patients will be able to access 31 designated centers nationwide, with each center offering access to the best possible coordinated multi-specialty clinical care and diagnostic opportunities for rare diseases.
    NORD’s Rare Disease CoE Program is the first-ever designation program dedicated to all rare diseases and the patients impacted by them. The Centers that form the NORD CoE network will work in partnership to share expertise, advance education, define standards and protocols, and shape the field of rare disease care, ultimately enabling rare disease patients to better navigate their diagnostic journey and find qualified medical homes for their complex medical conditions.</p>

<h2 class="head2Style">Rare Disorders</h2>
<p class="par4Style">The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) is a nonprofit voluntary health agency that serves as a clearinghouse for information on rare disorders. A rare disorder is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 Americans. Cumulatively, there are more than 7,000 rare diseases affecting more than 30 million Americans. NORD is committed to the identification, treatment, and cure of rare diseases through education, advocacy, research, and service programs. NORD administers medication assistance programs for certain rare-disease drugs as well as research grants and fellowships.</p>
